# Discord OpenAI Bot

This bot uses OpenAI to generate responses to messages in a Discord server. It listens for mentions of the bot and generates responses using OpenAI's GPT chat model. It has some special functionality to track the number of times a user has mentioned the bot recently and limit the number of OpenAI calls.

It has a couple of extra options to do common things.  Eg:
```
@Gepetto create an image of a rocket flying through space
@Gepetto can you summarised this webpage? https://www.example.com/an/article
@Gepetto ðŸ‘€ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=123f830q9>
@Gepetto ðŸ‘€ <https://www.example.com/an/article> can you give me the main insights on this as bullet points?
@Gepetto weather forecast for London today?
```
The youtube one depends on their being subtitles/transcripts attached to the video.  The summarise command is a little limited (currently hard-coded) in scope due to token limits on the text you can send to the cheaper OpenAI models.

It has a few 'timed' features too :

* Once a day read the channel history and use an image generator (via replicate) to create an image based on the chat.
* Randomly through the night post very short 'horror stories' (usually just a single sentence)
* Occassionally just interject some chat (disabled by default as it's quite annoying)
